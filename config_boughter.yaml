# Configuration file for Boughter Training - Novo Nordisk Reproduction
# Train on Boughter dataset, test on Jain dataset

# Model configuration
model:
  name: "facebook/esm1v_t33_650M_UR90S_1"  # ESM-1V model from HuggingFace (pretrained)
  device: "mps"  # [cuda, cpu, mps] - use MPS for Apple Silicon

# Data configuration
data:
  source: "local"
  dataset_name: "boughter_vh"
  train_file: ./train_datasets/boughter/VH_only_boughter_training.csv  # Boughter VH training data (filtered)
  val_file: null    # No validation set - use CV instead
  test_file: ./test_datasets/jain/VH_only_jain_test.csv   # Jain VH test data (94 curated antibodies, no NaNs)

  # Data format options
  sequence_column: "sequence"  # Column name for protein sequences
  label_column: "label"       # Column name for binary labels

  # Data preprocessing
  max_sequence_length: 1024   # Maximum sequence length for ESM tokenizer

  # Data storage
  save_embeddings: true       # Cache embeddings for faster re-runs

# Classifier configuration - matches Novo Nordisk methodology
classifier:
  type: "logistic_regression"  # Novo uses LogisticReg
  max_iter: 1000              # Maximum iterations for convergence
  random_state: 42            # Seed for reproducibility
  class_weight: null          # None - Boughter is already balanced (48.5%/51.5%)

  # Cross-validation settings (performed on training data only)
  cv_folds: 10                # Novo uses 10-fold CV
  stratify: true              # Stratified CV for balanced folds
