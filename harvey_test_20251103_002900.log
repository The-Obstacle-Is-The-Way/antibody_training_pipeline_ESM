Loading model from models/boughter_vh_esm1v_logreg.pkl...
Some weights of EsmModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/esm1v_t33_650M_UR90S_1 and are newly initialized: ['contact_head.regression.bias', 'contact_head.regression.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
