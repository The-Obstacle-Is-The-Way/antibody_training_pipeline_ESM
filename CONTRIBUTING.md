# CONTRIBUTING

**1.** We write clean, tested, typed, linted code. Test-driven development is the standard.

**2.** We ship with velocity and iterate. We learn by building and say no to mental masturbation.

**3.** We work with Git workflows and GitHub operations for maximal traceability and provenance.
