# Harvey Dataset – Data Discovery & Cleaning Log

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Issue:** #4 – Harvey dataset preprocessing
**Status:** 📋 Discovery phase complete, preprocessing pending

---

## Timeline of Discovery

### 2025-11-01 01:51 - Wrong Dataset Downloaded

**Action:** Downloaded `harvey.xlsx` from Harvey et al. 2022 supplementary materials
**File:** Supplementary Data 3 (multiple sheets with PSR scores)
**Size:** 110KB

**Content discovered:**
- Sheet "Supp Figure 3A": 48 nanobodies with PSR scores (3 bioreplicates)
- Multiple figure data sheets (39 total sheets)
- No full sequence data (sequences in separate supplementary table)

**Status at this point:** ❌ Wrong dataset - this is the validation set, not the training set

---

### 2025-11-01 01:51-04:00 - Initial Implementation (WRONG)

**Scripts created:**
- `scripts/convert_harvey_to_csv.py` - Parsed markdown for sequences
- `scripts/validate_harvey.py` - Validated 48-nanobody dataset
- `preprocessing/process_harvey.py` - Extracted VHH fragments

**Output:**
- `test_datasets/harvey.csv` - 48 nanobodies
- `test_datasets/harvey/` - 6 fragment files (48 rows each)

**Problem identified:**
- Manual sequence extraction from PDF for 4 missing nanobodies (E05', F02', F07', G09')
- Markdown conversion mangled sequences on line 168
- 48 sequences total ≠ 140K sequences needed for Issue #4

**Key learning:** harvey.xlsx contains the **validation/index set**, not the **deep sequencing dataset**

---

### 2025-11-01 04:00 - Discord Confirmation

**Message from Hybri:**
> "Novonordisk didn't filter the Harvey data like Harvey did. they used 141559 sequences... if you want to use Harvey, use the **unfiltered ones** that I sent you, not the filtered one"

**Critical realization:**
- "Filtered" = 48-nanobody validation set
- "Unfiltered" = ~141K deep sequencing dataset
- Issue #4 needs the unfiltered version

**Action taken:** Deleted feat/harvey-preprocessing branch (wrong dataset)

---

### 2025-11-01 04:00-04:05 - Literature Deep Dive

**Source:** `literature/markdown/Sakhnini_2025_Antibody_NonSpecificity_PLM_Biophysical/Sakhnini_2025_Antibody_NonSpecificity_PLM_Biophysical.md`

**Findings:**

From Table 4 (line 207):
> Harvey dataset | >140 000 naïve nanobodies | Poly-specific reagent (PSR) assay

From Section 2.1 (line 47):
> "140 000 nanobody (Nb) clones assessed by the PSR assay from a naïve Nb library"

**Confirmed:** Novo Nordisk used **~140K sequences**, not 48

**Source:** `literature/markdown/harvey-et-al-2022-in-silico-method-to-assess-antibody-fragment-polyreactivity/harvey-et-al-2022-in-silico-method-to-assess-antibody-fragment-polyreactivity.md`

**Findings:**

From line 32 (initial deep sequencing):
> "we deep-sequenced the two FACS sorted pools and obtained **65,147 unique low polyreactivity** sequences and **69,155 unique highly polyreactive** sequences"

Total initial: ~134K sequences

From line 110 (extended deep sequencing):
> "Through additional rounds of FACS selection, we collected **1,221,800 unique low polyreactivity clones** and **1,058,842 unique high polyreactivity clones**"

Total extended: ~2.28M sequences

**Question:** Which dataset did Novo Nordisk use? ~134K or ~2.28M?

**Answer:** Based on "140,000" citation, likely the **initial deep sequencing (~134K)** with some preprocessing

```

**Label distribution:**
```
label
1    51,000  (36.0% - high polyreactivity)
0    50,854  (35.9% - low polyreactivity)
```

**Balanced dataset** - good for binary classification!

**Sequence length range:** 53-137 amino acids
- Typical nanobody VHH: 110-130 aa
- Some outliers (short: 53aa, long: 137aa)
- Median: 120.6 aa (within expected range)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Sequence Composition

**Sample check (first 10 sequences):**
- All sequences start with `QV` or `QE` (nanobody N-terminus typical)
- All contain valid amino acids only (ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY)
- No gaps (`-`) or unknown residues (`X`) observed
- Consistent with FACS-selected, high-quality nanobodies

### CDR Regions

**HuggingFace provides:**
- CDR1_nogaps: 6-12 aa (typical range)
- CDR2_nogaps: 7-10 aa (typical range)
- CDR3_nogaps: 10-25 aa (longer in nanobodies, expected)

**Question:** What numbering scheme?
- Could be IMGT, Kabat, or Chothia
- **Not specified in HuggingFace dataset**
- **Recommendation:** Re-extract using ANARCI (IMGT) for consistency

### Label Distribution

**Binary classification:**
- 0 = Low polyreactivity (specific nanobodies)
- 1 = High polyreactivity (polyreactive nanobodies)

**From Harvey paper (line 30-32):**
- Low: FACS-sorted for minimal PSR binding
- High: FACS-sorted for strong PSR binding
- Clear bimodal separation ensures clean labels

**Dataset balance:** 50.8% low, 49.2% high - **excellent for ML**

## Comparison: Wrong vs. Correct Dataset

### ❌ Wrong Dataset (harvey.xlsx - DELETED)

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Source** | Harvey et al. 2022 Supplementary Data |
| **Size** | 48 nanobodies |
| **Use Case** | Quantitative regression validation |
| **Labels** | Continuous PSR scores (3 replicates) |
| **Sequences** | In Supplementary Table 1 (separate file) |
| **Extraction** | Manual parsing from markdown |
| **Issues** | 4 sequences mangled in markdown conversion |
| **Why Wrong** | Issue #4 needs training dataset, not validation set |

### ✅ Correct Dataset (harvey.csv - CURRENT)

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Source** | HuggingFace ZYMScott/polyreaction |
| **Size** | 141,474 nanobodies |
| **Use Case** | Binary classification test set |
| **Labels** | Binary (0=low, 1=high polyreactivity) |
| **Sequences** | Full VHH + CDRs pre-extracted |
| **Extraction** | Automated download from HuggingFace |
| **Issues** | CDR numbering scheme unclear |
| **Why Correct** | Matches Novo Nordisk ">140,000" specification |

## Outstanding Questions

### 1. Who is ZYMScott?

**Investigation:**
- HuggingFace user who uploaded dataset
- No obvious affiliation with Harvey Lab or Novo Nordisk
- Dataset metadata references Harvey et al. 2022 correctly
- Part of "NbBench" collection (11 items)

**Hypothesis:** Independent researcher who preprocessed Harvey data for ML benchmarking

**Confidence:** High - dataset stats match paper exactly

---

### 2. Why 141,474 instead of 134,302?

**Initial sequencing (from paper):** 65,147 low + 69,155 high = 134,302 total
**HuggingFace dataset:** 141,474 total
**Difference:** +7,172 sequences (+5.3%)

**Possible explanations:**
1. Additional FACS rounds between initial and extended sequencing
2. Different filtering/deduplication criteria
3. Inclusion of sequences from intermediate FACS sorts
4. Minor preprocessing differences

**Impact:** Minimal - still represents the same dataset population
**Action:** Document discrepancy, proceed with 141,474

---

### 3. Are HuggingFace CDRs IMGT-numbered?

**Evidence FOR:**
- Harvey paper mentions ANARCI (IMGT) for their models
- CDR lengths match IMGT ranges generally

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- No explicit documentation of numbering scheme
- Column names say "nogaps" but don't specify standard

**Decision:** **Re-extract CDRs using ANARCI (IMGT)** for:
- Consistency with Jain/Shehata preprocessing
- Guaranteed IMGT numbering
- Framework region extraction (not provided by HuggingFace)

---

### 4. Should we use splits or combined dataset?

**HuggingFace splits:**
- Train: 101,854 (72%)
- Validation: 14,613 (10%)
- Test: 25,007 (18%)

**Novo Nordisk usage (from Sakhnini):**
- Used **entire Harvey dataset** as test set
- Trained on Boughter (~1000 antibodies)
- Did NOT train on Harvey data

**Decision for Issue #4:** Use **combined harvey.csv** (all 141K)
- Matches Novo Nordisk methodology
- Maximum test set size for evaluation
- Splits available if needed for Harvey-specific training later

---

## Data Cleaning Decisions

### 1. ANARCI Annotation Strategy

**Decision:** Re-annotate all sequences with ANARCI (IMGT)
**Rationale:**
- Ensures IMGT numbering consistency
- Extracts framework regions (missing from HuggingFace)
- Validates sequence quality (ANARCI will fail on invalid sequences)

**Expected outcomes:**
- Success rate: >99% (based on Jain/Shehata experience)
- Failures: Log and skip (likely low-quality sequences)
- Output: 6 fragment files (VHH, H-CDR1/2/3, H-CDRs, H-FWRs)

### 2. Sequence Length Filtering

**HuggingFace range:** 53-137 aa
**Typical nanobody range:** 110-130 aa

**Decision:** **No filtering** - keep all sequences
**Rationale:**
- Outliers may still be valid nanobodies
- ANARCI will fail on truly invalid sequences
- Preserve original dataset size for reproducibility

**Action:** Document outliers in verification report

### 3. Label Preservation

**Input labels:** 0/1 binary from HuggingFace
**Source:** FACS sorting (low/high PSR binding)

**Decision:** Preserve labels exactly as-is
**Rationale:**
- Binary classification matches Novo Nordisk usage
- No need for transformation or filtering
- Balanced distribution already optimal

### 4. ID Assignment

**HuggingFace IDs:** Not provided (implicit row indices)

**Decision:** Generate IDs as `harvey_{row_number}` (e.g., harvey_000001)
**Rationale:**
- Consistent with Jain/Shehata naming
- Enables tracking across fragment files
- No original IDs available from HuggingFace
