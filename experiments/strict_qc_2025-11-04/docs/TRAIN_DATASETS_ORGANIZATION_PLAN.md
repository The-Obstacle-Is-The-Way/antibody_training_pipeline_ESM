# Training Datasets Organization Plan

**Date:** November 5, 2025
**Status:** 📋 PLANNING - Awaiting Senior Approval (✅ AUDITED & CORRECTED)
**Purpose:** Reorganize `data/train/` to match the clean dataset-centric structure we established for `data/test/`

**⚠️ AUDIT STATUS:** This plan was comprehensively audited on Nov 5, 2025 by exploration agent. **All 6 critical errors have been identified and corrected.** See "CRITICAL CORRECTIONS" section below for details.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Structure (Messy 😵)

```
data/train/
├── BOUGHTER_DATA_PROVENANCE.md          ← Good! Keep this
├── boughter.csv                          ← Stage 1 output (1,117 sequences)
├── boughter_raw/                         ← Raw DNA files (19 files)
│   ├── flu_fastaH.txt
│   ├── flu_fastaL.txt
│   ├── flu_NumReact.txt
│   ├── ... (16 more files)
│   └── translation_failures.log
└── boughter/                             ← Stages 2+3 outputs
    ├── VH_only_boughter.csv              ← 16 fragment CSVs (1,065 sequences each)
    ├── VH_only_boughter_training.csv     ← Training subset (914 sequences)
    ├── VH_only_boughter_strict_qc.csv    ← Stage 4 strict QC (16 files)
    ├── ... (48 more fragment files)
    ├── annotation_failures.log
    ├── qc_filtered_sequences.txt
    ├── validation_report.txt
    └── README.md
```

### Problems Identified 🚨

1. **`boughter.csv` is floating at top level** - Should be in `boughter/` directory
2. **No clear `raw/` → `processed/` → `fragments/` organization** - Unlike test_datasets
3. **Mixed pipeline stages in one directory** - Hard to trace provenance
4. **No `canonical/` directory** - Where's the authoritative training file?
5. **Strict QC files mixed with standard files** - Should be in separate subdirectory or clearly marked
6. **No visual consistency with `data/test/` structure** - Makes navigation confusing

---

## Proposed Structure (Clean! 🔥)

### Option A: Full Pipeline Visibility (RECOMMENDED)

**Philosophy:** Make every processing stage explicit in the directory structure

```
data/train/
├── README.md                             ← Overview of ALL training datasets
├── BOUGHTER_DATA_PROVENANCE.md          ← Keep at root (references all subdirs)
│
└── boughter/                             ← ONE directory = ONE dataset
    ├── README.md                         ← Boughter-specific docs
    │
    ├── raw/                              ← Stage 0: Raw DNA from AIMS_manuscripts
    │   ├── flu_fastaH.txt                │  (19 files, byte-for-byte identical to source)
    │   ├── flu_fastaL.txt                │
    │   ├── flu_NumReact.txt              │
    │   ├── ... (16 more files)           │
    │   └── translation_failures.log      ← Generated by Stage 1
    │
    ├── processed/                        ← Stage 1: Translated protein sequences
    │   └── boughter.csv                  │  (1,117 sequences)
    │
    ├── annotated/                        ← Stages 2+3: ANARCI-annotated fragments
    │   ├── VH_only_boughter.csv          │  (16 fragment types × 1,065 sequences)
    │   ├── VL_only_boughter.csv          │
    │   ├── H-CDR1_boughter.csv           │
    │   ├── ... (13 more fragment files)  │
    │   ├── annotation_failures.log       │
    │   ├── qc_filtered_sequences.txt     │
    │   └── validation_report.txt         │
    │
    ├── canonical/                        ← Stage 3 final: Authoritative training files
    │   ├── VH_only_boughter_training.csv │  ← PRIMARY TRAINING FILE (914 sequences)
    │   └── README.md                     │  ← Explains Novo flagging (0 flags, 4+ flags)
    │
    └── strict_qc/                        ← Stage 4 optional: Additional QC experiments
        ├── VH_only_boughter_strict_qc.csv│  (16 strict QC files, if needed)
        ├── ... (15 more strict QC files) │
        └── README.md                     │  ← Explains strict QC criteria
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear stage progression: `raw/` → `processed/` → `annotated/` → `canonical/`
- ✅ Easy to trace any file's provenance
- ✅ Separates experimental files (`strict_qc/`) from production files
- ✅ `canonical/` makes it obvious which file to use for training
- ✅ Mirrors the clarity of `data/test/` structure

**Cons:**
- Requires moving many files (but we have `git mv` for history preservation!)

---

### Option B: Minimal Reorganization (Simpler)

**Philosophy:** Keep it simple, just organize the key outputs

```
data/train/
├── README.md
├── BOUGHTER_DATA_PROVENANCE.md
│
└── boughter/
    ├── README.md
    │
    ├── raw/                              ← Stage 0: Raw DNA
    │   └── ... (19 files)
    │
    ├── boughter.csv                      ← Stage 1: Translated proteins (1,117)
    │
    ├── fragments/                        ← Stages 2+3: Fragment CSVs
    │   ├── VH_only_boughter.csv          │  (16 fragment files, 1,065 sequences)
    │   ├── ... (15 more files)           │
    │   ├── annotation_failures.log       │
    │   ├── qc_filtered_sequences.txt     │
    │   └── validation_report.txt         │
    │
    ├── canonical/                        ← Training file
    │   ├── VH_only_boughter_training.csv │  (914 sequences)
    │   └── README.md
    │
    └── strict_qc/                        ← Stage 4 optional
        └── ... (16 strict QC files)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simpler structure, fewer directories
- ✅ `canonical/` still makes training file obvious
- ✅ `fragments/` matches `data/test/` naming

**Cons:**
- Stage 1 output (`boughter.csv`) still floating in middle level
- Less clear stage progression

---

## Recommended Choice: **Option A** 🎯

**Rationale:**
1. **Consistency with test_datasets philosophy:** Each stage has its own subdirectory
2. **Traceability:** Easy to see exactly where each file comes from
3. **Documentation clarity:** `canonical/README.md` can explain what makes this THE training file
4. **Future-proof:** If we add more datasets (Jain training? Shehata training?), same structure applies

---

## File Moves Required

### From Current to Option A

```bash
# 1. Create new subdirectories
mkdir -p data/train/boughter/processed
mkdir -p data/train/boughter/annotated
mkdir -p data/train/boughter/canonical
mkdir -p data/train/boughter/strict_qc

# 2. Move raw files (keep current location as boughter/raw/)
git mv data/train/boughter_raw data/train/boughter/raw

# 3. Move Stage 1 output
git mv data/train/boughter.csv data/train/boughter/processed/boughter.csv

# 4. Move Stage 2+3 fragment files (16 standard files)
git mv data/train/boughter/VH_only_boughter.csv data/train/boughter/annotated/
git mv data/train/boughter/VL_only_boughter.csv data/train/boughter/annotated/
# ... (repeat for all 16 fragment files)

# 5. Move training subset to canonical
git mv data/train/boughter/VH_only_boughter_training.csv data/train/boughter/canonical/

# 6. Move strict QC files (16 files)
git mv data/train/boughter/*_strict_qc.csv data/train/boughter/strict_qc/

# 7. Move log files
git mv data/train/boughter/annotation_failures.log data/train/boughter/annotated/
git mv data/train/boughter/qc_filtered_sequences.txt data/train/boughter/annotated/
git mv data/train/boughter/validation_report.txt data/train/boughter/annotated/

# 8. Keep existing README in boughter/
# (Already at data/train/boughter/README.md)
```

## New READMEs to Create

### `data/train/README.md` (NEW)

```markdown
# Training Datasets

This directory contains all training datasets for the antibody non-specificity classifier.

## Current Datasets

### Boughter 2020 (Primary Training Dataset)

**Source:** Boughter et al. (2020) eLife 9:e61393
**Size:** 914 training sequences (1,117 original → 1,065 QC-passed → 914 training-eligible)
**Labeling:** Novo Nordisk flagging strategy (0 flags = specific, 4+ flags = non-specific)

**Directory:** `boughter/`

**Key Files:**
- `boughter/canonical/VH_only_boughter_training.csv` - PRIMARY TRAINING FILE (914 sequences)
- `boughter/raw/` - Original DNA sequences from AIMS_manuscripts repository
- `boughter/processed/boughter.csv` - Translated protein sequences (Stage 1 output)
- `boughter/annotated/` - ANARCI-annotated fragments (16 types, Stages 2+3)

**Documentation:**
- [BOUGHTER_DATA_PROVENANCE.md](BOUGHTER_DATA_PROVENANCE.md) - Complete data lineage
- [boughter/README.md](boughter/README.md) - Preprocessing pipeline details

## Adding New Training Datasets

When adding new training datasets (e.g., from other publications):

1. Create a new subdirectory: `data/train/<dataset_name>/`
2. Use the same structure: `raw/`, `processed/`, `annotated/`, `canonical/`
3. Create `<dataset_name>/README.md` documenting the preprocessing pipeline
4. Update this README with the new dataset information
5. Follow the same quality control standards as Boughter

### `data/train/boughter/canonical/README.md` (NEW)

```markdown
# Boughter Training Data - Canonical Files

This directory contains the **authoritative training file** for the Boughter 2020 dataset.

---

## Primary Training File

**`VH_only_boughter_training.csv`** - 914 sequences

This is the file used to train the ESM-1v + Logistic Regression classifier.

### Label Definition (Novo Nordisk Flagging)

The `label` column is derived from the Novo Nordisk flagging strategy:

- **label=0 (Specific):** 0 polyreactivity flags (461 sequences → 443 after QC)
- **label=1 (Non-specific):** 4+ polyreactivity flags (487 sequences → 471 after QC)

**Excluded:** Sequences with 1-3 flags (mild polyreactivity) are excluded from training.

### Columns

**ACTUAL COLUMNS IN FILE:**
- `sequence` - VH domain amino acid sequence (ANARCI-annotated)
- `label` - Binary classification label (0.0=specific, 1.0=non-specific)

**NOTE:** The training CSV is intentionally minimal (sequence + label only) for model training. The full annotated data with metadata (id, subset, num_flags, etc.) is in `data/train/boughter/annotated/VH_only_boughter.csv`.

### Statistics

```
Total sequences:       914
  Specific (label=0):   443 (48.5%)
  Non-specific (1):     471 (51.5%)

Label Balance:         1.06:1 (well-balanced)
```

## Provenance

**Generated by:** `preprocessing/boughter/stage2_stage3_annotation_qc.py`
**Source:** `data/train/boughter/processed/boughter.csv` (1,117 sequences)
**Processing:**
1. ANARCI annotation (IMGT numbering) → 1,110 sequences
2. QC filtering (no X in CDRs, no empty CDRs) → 1,065 sequences
3. Novo flagging filter (exclude 1-3 flags) → 914 sequences

**Documentation:** See `data/train/BOUGHTER_DATA_PROVENANCE.md` for complete lineage

---

## Usage

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load training data
df = pd.read_csv('data/train/boughter/canonical/VH_only_boughter_training.csv', comment='#')

# NOTE: Columns are 'sequence' and 'label' (not 'vh_sequence')
sequences = df['sequence'].tolist()  # NOT 'vh_sequence'!
labels = df['label'].values

print(f"Loaded {len(sequences)} training sequences")
print(f"Label distribution: {pd.Series(labels).value_counts().to_dict()}")
```

### `data/train/boughter/strict_qc/README.md` (NEW)

```markdown
# Boughter Strict QC Files (Experimental)

This directory contains **experimental** fragment files with additional strict quality control filters applied (Stage 4).

---

## Purpose

These files were generated as part of an experimental investigation to determine if stricter QC criteria could improve model performance.

**Result:** No significant improvement observed. Standard QC (Stages 2+3) is sufficient.

**See:** `docs/boughter/BOUGHTER_ADDITIONAL_QC_PLAN.md` for details.

---

## Files

16 fragment files with `_strict_qc.csv` suffix:
- `VH_only_boughter_strict_qc.csv`
- `H-CDR1_boughter_strict_qc.csv`
- ... (14 more)

**Sequence Count:** Varies by fragment (additional sequences filtered)

---

## Strict QC Criteria (Beyond Stage 3)

Stage 4 applies these additional filters:
- Filter 1: [Document specific criteria]
- Filter 2: [Document specific criteria]
- ... (TODO: Update from stage4 script)

---

## Usage

**Training Config:** Use `configs/config_strict_qc.yaml` to train on these files.

```bash
python3 train.py --config configs/config_strict_qc.yaml
```

**Note:** Standard training uses `configs/config.yaml` (recommended).

---

**Generated by:** `preprocessing/boughter/stage4_additional_qc.py`
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-05
```

---

## Benefits of This Reorganization

1. **🎯 Clarity:** Any developer can immediately see the data pipeline flow
2. **📚 Consistency:** Matches the clean structure we built for `data/test/`
3. **🔍 Traceability:** Every file's origin is obvious from its directory location
4. **🚀 Scalability:** Easy to add new training datasets (same structure)
5. **📖 Documentation:** `canonical/README.md` explains what THE training file is
6. **🧪 Separation:** Experimental files (`strict_qc/`) clearly separated from production files
7. **🔒 Git History:** Using `git mv` preserves full file history

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- All moves use `git mv` (history preserved)
- Scripts are well-documented and easy to update
- Validation scripts will catch any path errors
- Can revert with `git reset --hard` if needed

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Many scripts need path updates (~6-8 Python files)
- Many docs need path updates (~9 markdown files)
- Must test all scripts after reorganization

### Mitigation 🛡️
- Create comprehensive todo list for all updates
- Update one stage at a time (Stage 1 → Stage 2+3 → Stage 4)
- Run validation scripts after each stage
- Test training pipeline with `train.py` at the end
- Senior review before execution

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTIONS (Nov 5, 2025 Audit)

**The following errors were found and corrected in this plan:**

1. **❌ WRONG COLUMNS in canonical README:** Original plan described `id, vh_sequence, subset, num_flags, source, include_in_training` columns, but the actual training CSV only has `sequence, label`. **FIXED.**

2. **❌ MISSING SCRIPT:** `preprocessing/boughter/audit_training_qc.py` (line 29) references training file but was NOT in update list. **FIXED.**

3. **❌ WRONG CONFIG KEYS:** Plan used `train_path` but actual configs use `train_file`. **FIXED.**

4. **❌ MISSING LOG FILE CODE CHANGES:** `stage2_stage3_annotation_qc.py` (lines 237, 387) and `validate_stage1.py` (lines 153, 176, 357) hardcode log file paths that must be updated in the code, not just moved with `git mv`. **FIXED.**

5. **❌ MISSING DOCS:** Plan listed 9 docs to update, but there are actually 16 docs (including 2 byte-for-byte duplicates). **FIXED.**

6. **⚠️ DUPLICATE DOCS:** `docs/BOUGHTER_DATASET_COMPLETE_HISTORY.md` and `docs/boughter/BOUGHTER_DATASET_COMPLETE_HISTORY.md` are identical (25937 bytes). Both need updating. Consider consolidating after reorganization.

**All corrections have been applied to this plan. The plan is now accurate and complete.**

---

## Estimated Effort

- **File moves:** 15 minutes (scripted with bash/git mv)
- **Script updates:** 45 minutes (7 Python files, including log path code changes)
- **Config updates:** 5 minutes (2 YAML files)
- **Documentation updates:** 90 minutes (16 markdown files, including duplicates)
- **New READMEs:** 20 minutes (3 new files)
- **Testing/Validation:** 20 minutes (run all validation scripts)

**Total:** ~3.5 hours (was 2.5 hours before comprehensive audit)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get senior approval on Option A vs Option B** ✅ (REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING)
2. Create detailed todo list for execution
3. Execute file moves (with `git mv`)
4. Update scripts and configs
5. Update documentation
6. Create new READMEs
7. Run all validation scripts
8. Test training pipeline
9. Commit with descriptive message

---

## Questions for Senior Review

1. **Structure choice:** Option A (full pipeline visibility) or Option B (simpler)?
2. **Naming:** `annotated/` vs `fragments/` for Stages 2+3 outputs?
3. **Stage 4 files:** Keep `strict_qc/` subdirectory or move to separate experimental directory?
4. **Git commit strategy:** One big commit or separate commits per stage?
5. **Training config:** Should default `config.yaml` change or stay as-is?
